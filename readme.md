# CoralHR Lite Q&A

**Can I change the date and time?**

```
Yes. Click on the time OR date to change them
```

**I check in through Web and choose "Lokasi Lain" but when I open Lite to check out, I can't see the entry**

```
This is not a bug. Lite will not fetch from DB all your check in locations to improve performance. You can only check in/out using Lite for location which has been added from the menu within Lite
```

**Can I check in on Location A, then check in on Location B on the same day?**

```
Yes. Same like Web version. It is not compulsory to check out.

However, if you haven't check out on Location A, upon check in on Location B, Lite will auto check out for you on Location A (less 1 minute from Location B). If you don't like this behavior, you must check out on Location A before check in on Location B.
```

**Where is the list of all my check in/out?**

```
Lite intension is to ease the process of daily check in (for those who love to check in on daily basis) especially on regular place. You can view/edit/delete all history through Web.
